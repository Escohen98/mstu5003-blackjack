# Blackjack game built entirely using Python Flask.

I was warned not to do it. I was warned that Python Flask was not meant to be interactive. I ignored those warnings and now here I am ........

This is a mess. Let's see if it'll work ðŸ™‚

Setup:
1. Install python 3.X
2. Install python flask: pip3 install flask
3. Navigate to the working directory
4. Run the dang program
