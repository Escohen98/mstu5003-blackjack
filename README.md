# Blackjack game built entirely using Python Flask.

Holy cow, what a time. I spent way too much time with this.

## Pro Tip:

When someone tells you not to use Python Flask for interactions, just don't do it. It's not worth the time.

Setup:
1. Install python 3.X
2. Install python flask: pip3 install flask
3. Navigate to the working directory
4. Run the dang program (python3 app.py)
